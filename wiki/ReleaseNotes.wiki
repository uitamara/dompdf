For a full list of modifications since DOMPDF 0.6.0 beta 1 see the [http://code.google.com/p/dompdf/source/list?path=/tags/dompdf_0-6-0_beta2&num=104 repository changelog]

 == Known Issues ==

  * Table cells cannot be split over multiple pages
  * Column widths of tables that span more than one page may not be consistent across pages

 == Installation Notes ==

  * Starting with dompdf 0.6.0 dompdf.php will no longer allow conversion of HTML document on the local file system that are located outside of the path specified by DOMPDF_CHROOT
  * The format of the font metrics cache has changed as of this release. You should manually remove any existing font metrics prior to upgrading or use the setup/configuration tool to do so immediately after.
  * Inline PHP is *disabled* by default now (see DOMPDF_ENABLE_PHP)
  * Because additional configuration options have been added you will need to replace your dompdf_config.inc.php file with the new one. You may modify this file or copy your configuration settings to dompdf_config.custom.inc.php.
